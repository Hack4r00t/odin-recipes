    <!--Description-->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the
      oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian dish
      is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as
      ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices. The
      dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted during baking
    </p>

    <!--Ingredients-->
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
      <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Instructions-->
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the noodles: Boil lasagna noodles according to package
        instructions. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the meat sauce: In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium
        heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add ground beef and cook
        until browned. Drain excess fat. Stir in marinara sauce and season with
        salt and pepper. Simmer for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the cheese mixture: In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, 1
        cup of mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and the egg. Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>
        Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of
        a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place 3 lasagna noodles on top. Spread 1/3 of
        the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then 1/3 of the meat sauce. Repeat
        layers twice more, ending with meat sauce on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add final layer of cheese: Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of mozzarella
        cheese on top of the final meat sauce layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, you
        can spray the underside of the foil with cooking spray). Bake in the
        preheated oven for 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove foil and continue baking: Remove the foil and bake for an
        additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest before serving: Let the lasagna rest for about 10-15 minutes before
        cutting and serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
