  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Picanha is a fresh cut of beef that's especially popular and highly prized in Brazil. In the US, it's called sirloin
    cap, and in the UK, it's known as the rump cap. Picanha is situated on the back side of the animal, above the butt,
    where it sits on a fat cap.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's mostly used for churrasco – the meat is first grilled, then sliced off of a skewer. This cut holds very little
    fat in the meat, so it must be cooked perfectly in order not to make it tough. In Brazil, every churrasco has
    picanha,and all of the best churrascarias feature picanha on their menus.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Picanha (top sirloin cap) cut, about 2-3 lbs</li>
    <li>Coarse sea salt</li>
    <li>Black pepper (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the meat: Trim any silver skin from the meat side of the Picanha, but leave the fat cap intact. Score
      the fat cap lightly in a crosshatch pattern, being careful not to cut into the meat.</li>
    <li>Season: Generously season the Picanha all over with coarse sea salt. Optionally, you can also add freshly ground
      black pepper.</li>
    <li>Preheat the grill: Preheat your grill to high heat. If using charcoal, set up a two-zone fire.</li>
    <li>Grill the Picanha: Place the Picanha on the grill fat-side down. Sear for about 4-5 minutes, or until the fat is
      nicely browned and starting to render. Flip and sear the other side for an additional 4-5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Continue cooking: Move the Picanha to a cooler part of the grill (or reduce the heat to medium). Continue
      grilling, flipping occasionally, until the internal temperature reaches your desired doneness (130°F for
      medium-rare, 140°F for medium).</li>
    <li>Rest the meat: Remove the Picanha from the grill and let it rest for about 10 minutes to allow the juices to
      redistribute.</li>
    <li>Slice and serve: Slice the Picanha against the grain into thin strips. Serve immediately, optionally accompanied
      by chimichurri sauce or your favorite sides.</li>
  </ol>
