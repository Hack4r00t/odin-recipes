    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A hamburger, also called a burger, is a dish consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically
      beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
      <li>4 slices of cheese (optional)</li>
      <li>Lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, mustard, and other toppings of your choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the beef mixture: In a large bowl, combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, egg, onion, garlic,
        Worcestershire
        sauce, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.</li>
      <li>Form patties: Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a patty about 3/4 inch
        thick.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. You can also use a stovetop skillet or grill pan.
      </li>
      <li>Cook the patties: Place the patties on the grill. Cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until they reach
        your
        desired level of doneness. If using cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking to
        melt.
      </li>
      <li>Toast the buns: While the patties are cooking, toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster until
        lightly browned.</li>
      <li>Assemble the burgers: Place each patty on the bottom half of a bun. Add lettuce, tomato, pickles, and your
        preferred condiments. Cover with the top half of the bun.</li>
      <li>Serve: Serve the hamburgers immediately with your favorite sides.</li>
    </ol>
