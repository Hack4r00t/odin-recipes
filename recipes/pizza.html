    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is a traditional Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with
      tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
      <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Your choice of toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, etc.)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.
      </li>
      <li>Prepare the dough: Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer
        the
        dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Apply the sauce: Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
      <li>Add the cheese: Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, followed by grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li>Add toppings: Arrange your choice of toppings evenly over the cheese.</li>
      <li>Season: Drizzle olive oil over the toppings and sprinkle with dried oregano and garlic powder.</li>
      <li>Bake the pizza: Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven or pizza stone. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or
        until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
      <li>Garnish and serve: Remove the pizza from the oven. If desired, top with fresh basil leaves. Let it cool for a
        few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
